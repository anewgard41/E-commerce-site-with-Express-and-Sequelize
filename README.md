# E-commerce-site-with-Express-and-Sequelize

## Description

Utilize the power of Sequelize to create a full stack e-commerce application! Sequelize enables us to easily interact with a MySQL database using Node.js and Express.js. Users are easily able to view, add, update, and delete data from the database which includes things like products, categories, and tags. In order to build this application, specific ORM methods are used to interact with the database. Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database tables. The Express.js API is used to perform RESTful CRUD operations. The routes were organized using async/await and try/catch formatting instead of promises in order to make the code more readable. We also take advantage of dotenv which allows us to protect private credentials such as MySQL server passwords, usernames, and names of databases. 

## Up and Running

In order to use this application you will need Node.js, MySQL2, Sequelize, Express.js, and dotenv. For testing, we took advantage of the npm package nodemon, which automatically restarts the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. However, this won't be necessary for the user. 

Here is a link to a video walkthrough of the application: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JeKPisJ-voJpDBiZyh5z6_oaH7RakUNP/view?usp=sharing
